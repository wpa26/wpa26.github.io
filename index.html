        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <a href="http://hackaday.com/2017/05/23/run-from-the-sound-of-footsteps-in-blind-game-of-tag/" target="_blank"> Spooky Tag</a>, a two-player game of tag in which the player on the run can't see anything, and instead relies on the sound of footsteps on headphones to determine the location of the player who is "it". This is achieved by an FPGA calculating the Head Related Transfer Function, which receives the game state from an embedded Linux computer to feed directional footsteps through the headphones.<br />
        <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Fall2016_Projects/wpa26_sms675/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Vision Theremin</a>, a musical device which uses OpenCV on a Rasperry Pi 3 to calculate the area of the hand placed above it, which determines the frequency that is played. In addition, a series of knobs and switches control various attributes such as harmonics, wave shape and delay.
